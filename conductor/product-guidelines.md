# Product Guidelines

## Prose and Messaging
- **Respectful and Traditional:** The application should use formal and respectful language that acknowledges the religious significance of the content. Terminology should be accurate and follow established conventions in Quranic studies.

## Visual Identity
- **Blended Traditionalism:** While maintaining a native feel, the UI should incorporate subtle Islamic motifs or calligraphic accents. This creates a specialized atmosphere that respects the content without sacrificing platform consistency.
- **Platform-Native Foundations:** Use system fonts (SF Pro on macOS, Segoe UI on Windows) and standard UI components as the base, then layer on traditional accents.

## User Interface & Experience
- **Distraction-Free Focus:** The primary goal of the UI is to facilitate reading and contemplation. Use generous whitespace, high-quality typography, and avoid unnecessary visual noise.
- **Intuitive Audio Controls:** Audio playback should be easily accessible but secondary to the text itself. Use familiar media control patterns that feel integrated into each platform's environment.
